# Falling Objects
#### Just a little game in Rust that i'm making for fun and to learn how to make games xd
Its only dependency is [Macroquad](https://crates.io/crates/macroquad)

## How to compile?
You need [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html), a tool to compile Rust code.

And then, at the root of the project (assuming you've downloaded the repo) you need to execute `cargo build` in the terminal, or just `cargo run` if you wanna compile & run

#### You can add `--release` after the commands if you want to compile with optimisations!

(It should compile on Windows, Linux and Mac Os)
